This project is a web application that allows users to download videos from various social media platforms such as Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube (for now). The goal is to expand social media options in the future to include other platforms like Twitter (or X).

The application is built using a variety of technologies:

-   **Laravel**

-   **Vue.js**

-   **Inertia.js**

-   **Tailwind CSS (Tw Elements Plugin)**

-   **MySQL**

The project code is structured according to Laravel and Vue.js conventions, with server-side logic primarily located in the `app/` folder and client-side logic in the `resources/js/` folder.
